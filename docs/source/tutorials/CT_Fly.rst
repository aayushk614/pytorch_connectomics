Introduction
-------------

Indirect flight muscles (IFMs) in adult Drosophila provide the key power stroke for wing beating. They also serve as a valuable model for studying muscle
development. Such analyses are impeded by conventional histological
preparations and imaging techniques that limit exact morphometry of flight
muscles. In this tutorial, microCT scanning is employed on a tissue preparation
that retains muscle morphology under homeostatic conditions. Focusing on
a subset of IFMs called the dorsal longitudinal muscles (DLMs), it is found that
DLM volumes increase with age, partially due to the increased separation
between myofibrillar fascicles, in a sex-dependentmanner.The authors have uncovered
and quantified asymmetry in the size of these muscles on either side of the
longitudinal midline.Measurements of this resolution and scalemake substantive
studies that test the connection between form and function possible.


In this tutorial, you will learn how to predict the **volumetric instance masks** on the CT Fly
dataset released by Chaturvedi, et al. in 2019.

Semantic Segmentation
----------------------

This section provides step-by-step guidance for mitochondria segmentation with the EM benchmark datasets released by `Lucchi et al. <https://cvlab.epfl.ch/research/page-90578-en-html/research-medical-em-mitochondria-index-php/>`_.
We consider the task as a **semantic segmentation** task and predict the mitochondria pixels with encoder-decoder ConvNets similar to
the models used in affinity prediction in `neuron segmentation <https://zudi-lin.github.io/pytorch_connectomics/build/html/tutorials/snemi.html>`_. The evaluation of the mitochondria segmentation results is based on the F1 score and Intersection over Union (IoU).

.. note::
    Different from other EM connectomics datasets used in the tutorials, the dataset released by Lucchi et al. is an isotropic dataset,
    which means the spatial resolution along all three axes is the same. Therefore a completely 3D U-Net and data augmentation along z-x
    and z-y planes besides x-y planes are preferred.

All the scripts needed for this tutorial can be found at ``pytorch_connectomics/scripts/``. Need to pass the argument ``--config-file configs/Lucchi-Mitochondria.yaml`` during training and inference to load the required configurations for this task. 
The pytorch dataset class of lucchi data is :class:`connectomics.data.dataset.VolumeDataset`.

#. Get the dataset:

    Download the dataset from our server:

        .. code-block:: none

            wget https://hp03.mindhackers.org/rhoana_product/dataset/lucchi.zip
    
    For description of the data please check `the author page <https://www.epfl.ch/labs/cvlab/data/data-em/>`_.

#. Run the training script:

    .. code-block:: none

        $ source activate py3_torch
        $ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 python -u scripts/main.py \
          --config-file configs/Lucchi-Mitochondria.yaml

#. Visualize the training progress:

    .. code-block:: none

        $ tensorboard --logdir runs

#. Run inference on test image volume:

    .. code-block:: none

        $ source activate py3_torch
        $ CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7 python -u scripts/main.py \
          --config-file configs/Lucchi-Mitochondria.yaml --inference \
          --checkpoint outputs/Lucchi_mito_baseline/volume_100000.pth.tar

Our pretained model achieves a VOC score of **0.943** on the test set. Please check `BENCHMARK.md <https://github.com/zudi-lin/pytorch_connectomics/blob/master/BENCHMARK.md>`_ 
for detailed performance comparison and the pre-trained models.

Instance Segmentation
----------------------

This section provides step-by-step guidance for mitochondria segmentation with our benchmark datasets `MitoEM <https://donglaiw.github.io/page/mitoEM/index.html>`_.
We consider the task as 3D **instance segmentation** task and provide three different confiurations of the model output. 
The model is ``unet_res_3d``, similar to the one used in `neuron segmentation <https://zudi-lin.github.io/pytorch_connectomics/build/html/tutorials/snemi.html>`_.
The evaluation of the segmentation results is based on the AP-75 (average precision with an IoU threshold of 0.75).

    Complex mitochondria in the MitoEM dataset:(a) mitochondria-on-a-string (MOAS), and (b) dense tangle of touching instances. 
    Those challenging cases are prevalent but not covered in previous datasets.

.. note::
    The MitoEM dataset has two sub-datasets **Rat** and **Human** based on the source of the tissues. Three training configuration files on **MitoEM-Rat** 
    are provided in ``pytorch_connectomics/configs/MitoEM/`` for different learning targets of the model. 

.. note::
    Since the dataset is very large and can not be directly loaded into memory, we use the :class:`connectomics.data.dataset.TileDataset` dataset class that only 
    loads part of the whole volume by opening involved ``PNG`` images.

#. Introduction to the dataset:

    On the Harvard RC cluster, the datasets can be found at:

    .. code-block:: none

        /n/pfister_lab2/Lab/vcg_connectomics/mitochondria/miccai2020/rat

    and

    .. code-block:: none
